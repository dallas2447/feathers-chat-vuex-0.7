# feathers-chat-vuex

> Feathers Vuex 0.7 - This is the OLD VERSION

[Check out the new version based on Feathers-Vuex v3.0](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-chat-vuex)

This is an old version of the Feathers Chat single page application using [feathers-vuex](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-vuex).  It is no longer maintained now that there is a new version available at https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-chat-vuex.  It serves as a valuable comparison of the old way with the new Feathers-Vuex 3.0.

## API Setup
This project is designed to work alongside the [`feathers-chat`](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat) application.  Please make sure you have the `feathers-chat` server app running before you try to use this one.
